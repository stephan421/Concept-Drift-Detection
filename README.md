In this repository the source code related to the paper "Scalable Detection of Concept Drift: A Learning Technique Based on Support Vector Machines" presented on the FAIM2020 conference in Athens, Greece is provided.

Abstract:
The issue of concept drift describes how static machine-learning models build on historical data can become unreliable over time and pose asignificant challenge to many applications. Although, there is a growing body of literature investigating concept drift existing solutions are oftenlimited to a small number of samples or features and do not work well in big data scenarios (e.g. streaming data). We are proposing a novelalgorithm that extends the existing concept drift algorithm FLORA3 and is more suitable for large amounts of data. Our solution utilizes supportvector machines (SVMs) for the classification process and only builds new models if old SVM-models are not accurate any longer. Through thiscombination of dynamic and static approaches the algorithm is capable of effectively analyzing data streams of high volume. For evaluation, wetested our algorithm on the publicly available dataset elec2, which is based on the energy market in Australia. Our results show that the proposedalgorithm executes significantly faster compared to the FLORA3 algorithm while maintaining a high level of accuracy.
